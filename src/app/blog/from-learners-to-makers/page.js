                    🇮🇳 Introduction: The Challenge Before Us
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Every year, millions of students graduate — yet many
                    struggle to find employment. The reason isn’t lack of
                    intelligence — it’s the lack of real-world skills. India
                    doesn’t just need more degrees; it needs more doers. At BDS
                    Education, we believe the transformation begins in
                    classrooms — when students stop being learners only and
                    start becoming makers too. That’s where Teach It Yourself
                    (TIY) and Knowledge Through Projects come together to build
                    the India of Tomorrow.

                    Traditional education has done well to build knowledge — but
                    not always application. The future belongs to those who can
                    design, test, and iterate — skills that come from building.

                    When a student builds something — even a small blinking LED

                    electronics; they are building confidence, creativity, and
                    purpose.

                    TIY redefines the role of teachers. They are no longer
                    dispensers of content, but drivers of curiosity. When a
                    teacher learns along with students, two things happen:

                    innovators, and even entrepreneurs — leading by example.
