                    Every year, millions of students graduate ‚Äî yet many
                    struggle to find employment. The reason isn‚Äôt lack of
                    intelligence ‚Äî it‚Äôs the lack of real-world skills. India
                    doesn‚Äôt just need more degrees; it needs more doers. At BDS
                    Education, we believe the transformation begins in
                    classrooms ‚Äî when students stop being learners only and
                    start becoming makers too. That‚Äôs where Teach It Yourself
                    (TIY) and Knowledge Through Projects come together to build
                    the India of Tomorrow.
