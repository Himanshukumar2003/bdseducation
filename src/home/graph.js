Traditional education emphasizes memory over mastery, notes over know-how. Students remember concepts just long enough to write an exam — and then forget them.",

India doesn’t just need more degrees; it needs more doers. At BDS Education, we believe the transformation begins in classrooms — when students stop being learners only and start becoming makers too. That’s where Teach It Yourself (TIY) and Knowledge Through Projects come together to build the India of Tomorrow.",
